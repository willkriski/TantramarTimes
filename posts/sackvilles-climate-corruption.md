[On June 13, 2023 Matt Estabrooks stated that he couldnâ€™t support the motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFzKnVBEoRo) to appoint 3 new members to the Climate Change Advisory Committee (CCAC) citing various process issues but mainly that there are perceived conflicts of interest between proposed members such as Sabine Dietz who works in the climate change industry. There is a lot of money being made in consulting, government grants as well as implementing various climate change mitigation products and services such as what [EOS Eco-Energy](https://eosecoenergy.com/en/) provides.

[Originally a climate change roundtable was initiated by then Mayor John Higham](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/06/28/sackville-nb-climate-change-lens-mayors-roundtable) so it has a history of being intertwined with the council, with members being appointed to it by the council. They even have a full-time climate change coordinator which was half paid for by EOS Eco-Energy.

[As I mentioned before, there are various connections between people such as Eric Tsuz-King who is on the CCAC board, EOS Eco-Energy and even Mike Wilson, of the AIL plastics plant.](./sackvilles-climate-change-advisory-committee-seeming-lack-of-interest-in-the-ail-plastics-plant)

Instead, the committee should be a separate entity. Like any other resident or group, the committee could present its suggestions to the council at any point in time, which could then be considered and either accepted or rejected.
