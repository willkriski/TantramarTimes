In his response to an email dated May 22, 2022, Shawn Mesheau stated: “With the exception of some washrooms for staff, there is no effluent associated with the operations as it is a closed loop system.”

However, a short time after his email was sent it became clear that not only will effluent be created in the plastic pipe manufacturing process but this effluent will be stored on site in a tank that will be eventually trucked off site for treatment.

In an email from Shreesha Sanjaya (Process Improvement EIT for AIL) to the Environment and Local Government (ELG) and cc’d to Mike Wilson (AIL/Right Coast Realty) dated July 6, 2022: “Any contaminated water collected in the pit sump and sent to a 1800L holding tank to be sent out for processing (holding tank location in mechanical drawings).”

Given AIL’s track record of having current contamination on their Dorchester site from fuel tanks (see image below) there is a substantiated concern that these effluents could leak into the aquifer below. This aquifer is used by local residents and feeds Silver Lake. Unfortunately the AIL plastics plant is situated above a permeable soil layer making any leaks more likely to enter the aquifer.

Unfortunately these suggestions by the government are not a requirement.

Michel also asked a series of interesting questions on July 7, 2022 which the author hasn’t seen the answers to but could exist: “*There is an indication that a sump pit is going to be used to collect processed water which they described as contaminated. There isn’t a lot of information in the drawings that speak to the sump pit’s impermeability or control measures to prevent leakage into the environment. Additionally, there should be more information provided to understand how the contaminated water collected from the sump pit, that is going to be pumped into an 1,800 L tote, will be processed. For example, type and level of contamination, is it hazardous waste, how is the contamination level going be measured, where is it going to go, who is going to collect it, etc*.

*How will “clean” water be determined before it is directed to the stormwater management system?*“

Given the previous contamination of the former AIL facility along with the Town and Climate Change Advisory Committee’s seeming lack of interest in this plastic pipe manufacturing plant operating in Sackville, it is perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the future quality of life in Sackville.
