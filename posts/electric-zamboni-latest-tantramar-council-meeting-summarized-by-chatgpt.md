The following is an unedited bullet point summary of the Municipality of Tantramar Special Meeting on March 29, 2023 (original video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2EibgCdSJo)). This was generated using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) (AI) as well as a browser extension called [YouTubeDigest](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtubedigest-summarize-u/agjkjablkiapmpbeglmdcmhnihlofija). While ChatGPT limited the transcript size it could analyze at one time to about 10 minutes of the meeting (requiring 9-10 separate cut and paste steps), YouTubeDigest summarized the entire video right on the YouTube page for the video. YouTube videos come with an auto-generated transcript (assuming one wasn’t manually uploaded) which isn’t always correct and affects the text in the bullet points. The transcript can be obtained on any YouTube video by clicking the ellipsis underneath the video on the right hand side. So to be clear this is a two step process: obtain the auto-generated transcript then provide it to ChatGPT to write a bullet point summary or article. Auto-generated transcripts should get much better soon because AI is improving rapidly but Google would have to update this as they own YouTube and likely won’t be using ChatGPT technology on their site.

I asked for 30 bullet points as the initial 10 point summary was not detailed enough. Note that the YouTubeDigest extension contains the timestamps in the video.
