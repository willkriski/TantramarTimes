Considering what Bruce Wark recently did to [smear a female mayoral candidate](./far-left-sackville-journalists-bruce-wark-and-erica-butler-show-their-bias-in-smearing-female-mayoral-candidate/), perhaps it is not surprising that in 2012 Wark brought up a sexual assault victim’s history of drug use and solicitation which implied she was to blame for the assault.

[CTV News](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/small-town-torn-apart-by-controversial-radio-report-1.785179) wrote at the time, “The victim says the report re-victimized her and she believes the station – 91.9 Parrsboro Community Radio – is using its power to defend itself.” Many residents were also upset about the biased coverage: “I think it was terrible,” says area resident Elaine Fancey. “It shouldn’t have happened.”

The victim also said she was never called for comment on any of it, which rings a familiar bell. Many journalists/activists today also call people right before they publish an article so they can say they couldn’t reach the person for comment. The victim also said “He (Wark) didn’t explain why I was a drug user and why I got charged for solicitation. I just lost myself. I lost my kids. But he didn’t even put that in there, and that was part of the trial.”

According to CTV News, “A publication ban protects the victim’s identity, but the station went to court asking that a highly unusual ban on the name of the accused be lifted.”

Is that perhaps why Wark moved out of Parrsboro but is continuing the same type of salacious behaviour here in Tantramar region? Incredibly the author recently became aware that Wark had actually taught [journalism ethics in college](https://ukings.ca/people/bruce-wark/). Perhaps he needs to go back and review the material.
