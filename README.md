This is a blog that generates static pages for each post. Each post is stored in the `posts` folder as a markdown file. The blog is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I exported the Wordpress posts to markdown and stored them in the `posts` folder. The code gets the categories from the markdown files and generates a menu for the categories.
